**Fridge Assistant** is a Home Assistant custom integration that turns your fridge, freezer and pantry
into a searchable inventory. Every item gets a short code and a printable sticker, expiry dates are
estimated automatically from a 99-recipe database (or an LLM), and a mobile-first panel lets you add,
scan, and finish items right from your phone — standing in front of the open door.

It's built to be genuinely useful for a household with more than one person: every item remembers
*who* put it in, finishing an item (eaten / tossed) is logged with *who* and *when*, and there's a
full undo. It works completely offline; AI estimates and the printer add-on are both optional.

## AI disclosure

OpenAI Codex was used to produce enhancements in this fork, including the English food
catalogue, mobile layout changes, custom storage locations, and Use By / Best Before date
tracking and sticker labels. Its work included code changes, documentation and automated tests.
The enhancements were checked with automated tests, local browser previews and rendered sticker
previews. A live Home Assistant installation and physical printer have not been tested.

## Development backlog

See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) for unprioritised feature ideas and the
[Mealie integration plan](docs/mealie-integration-plan.md) for current work.
The Mealie catalogue preview lives on `feature/mealie-integration` and is not a stable release.
It adds optional Mealie URL/API-token settings and a **What can I cook?** entry point with
**Test connection** and **Refresh recipes**. Recipes also refresh at startup and every six hours.
Matching, ranking, AI review and shopping-list writes are not implemented yet.

## Features

- 📋 **Inventory** across named fridges, freezers and cupboards, with search and per-location filters.
- 📍 **Manage locations** — add, rename, reorder or archive storage spaces and choose their storage type.
- 🗓️ **Automatic expiry dates** from a built-in database of 99 common products & dishes (English, with Dutch search aliases),
  matched conservatively — it will ask rather than guess wrong.
- ✨ **AI estimates** for anything not in the database, via your existing Home Assistant conversation
  agent or a direct OpenAI key.
- 📚 **Templates manager** — view, edit, hide/restore built-ins, or add your own (with or without AI).
- 🏷️ **Unique item codes** (`AB12`-style) with an optional printed sticker (barcode included) via the
  companion label printer add-on.
- 🍱 **Portions** — split a batch (say, a big pan of lasagne) into up to 24 portions on one item.
  Each portion gets its own sub-code and sticker (`AB12-1`, `AB12-2`, …); scanning one marks exactly
  that portion eaten, and the last portion completes the item automatically.
- 🗂️ **Inspector drawer** — on desktop an item opens in a side drawer (the list stays visible and
  clickable); on mobile everything remains a bottom sheet. History and the templates manager use the
  same drawer.
- 📷 **Barcode scanning** — scan your own sticker to instantly find an item, or scan a retail barcode
  to add a new grocery product with its name/photo/quantity pre-filled.
- 👤 **Who added what** — items remember who put them in, shown with their Home Assistant person avatar.
- ✅ **Finish items** as *eaten* or *tossed*, logged in a paginated history with who/when — with undo.
- 🔔 **Expiry notifications** — a persistent notification + event fires daily (time configurable) for
  anything expired or expiring soon.
- 🧹 **Clean-up mode** — clear out everything past its date in one tap.
- 📱 **Mobile-first panel** — built for using with your phone in hand, standing at the open fridge door.
- 🌐 **Fully local** — works with zero internet access; AI estimates, barcode lookups and the printer
  add-on are all optional.

## How it works

### Inventory model

Every item lives in a named **location**, such as Kitchen fridge or Garage freezer,
and belongs to one of two **kinds**:

- 🥕 **ingredient** — a single product (milk, lettuce, cheese, ...)
- 🍲 **dish** — something prepared (leftovers, a home-cooked meal, ...)

Kind is derived from a set of 15 finer categories (vegetables, fruit, dairy, meat, fish, breakfast,
lunch, dinner, snack, bakery, sauces & spices, drinks, eggs, leftovers, other) but can always be
overridden per item. Prepared meals are categorised by the meal-time they're usually eaten at, so
the inventory can be filtered on e.g. "what dinners are in the freezer?".

### Use By and Best Before dates

Tick **Best Before date** in the item editor for a best-before date; leave it unticked for
**Use By**. The date label updates immediately. Templates use the same checkbox and save a
default date type which new items inherit; individual items can override it. Editing a template
does not change existing items. Existing inventory, templates and history default to Use By
when updating from an earlier release.

Stickers print **USE BY** or **BEST BEFORE** according to the item. Lists, item details and
notifications distinguish the two date types, including “Expired” versus “Past best before”.
Countdowns and reminder timing stay the same. Automations can pass `date_type: use_by` or
`date_type: best_before` in add/update actions; `expiry_date` remains the date field for both.

### Storage locations

Open **Manage locations** beside the inventory's location filters. Add a name, choose a
storage type, and optionally choose an emoji. You can also rename locations and use the arrow
buttons to reorder them. The first active location is the default for new items.

| Storage type | Example location | Shelf-life value used |
|---|---|---|
| Fridge | Kitchen fridge, Drinks fridge | `fridge` |
| Freezer | Garage freezer, Chest freezer | `freezer` |
| Cupboard | Pantry, Baking cupboard | `pantry` |

Templates and AI estimates keep these three shelf-life values; each physical location uses its
chosen type. Moving an existing item or changing a location's type keeps its expiry date.
The item editor offers a new estimate where available, which you can accept explicitly.
Estimates use the item's **date added**, so moving an item does not restart its storage duration.

**Archive** keeps a location visible on existing items and filters, but removes it from destinations
for new or moved items. **Restore** makes it selectable again. Remove is available only when the
location has no inventory items, and at least one active location must remain. Removed location
metadata is retained so old history entries can still be undone; a restored item can be moved to
an active location.

Updating from an earlier version keeps inventory, custom templates and history, and creates the
original three locations with their existing IDs (`fridge`, `freezer`, `pantry`). Renaming does not
change a location's ID. For automations, copy the **Location ID** from the manager and pass it as
the `location` field in add/update actions. Sensors, notifications and printed labels include custom
locations too.

### Item codes & stickers

Every item gets a unique 4-character code — two letters + two digits (e.g. `AB12`), with visually
ambiguous letters (I/O/Q) excluded so it always reads cleanly off a small sticker. The code format
(letters-first or digits-first) is configurable.

If the optional [Label Printer add-on](#optional-label-printer-add-on) is installed, a tap on 🏷️ prints
a sticker sized for a **DYMO 99014** label (54 × 101 mm) with the item name, a scannable Code 39 barcode
of the item code, the storage date, a bold "eat before" date, contents, and quantity/servings.

### Portions

Cooked a big batch? Set a portion count when adding the item (or later, in the inspector) and the
batch stays **one item** in the list instead of three duplicates. Each portion gets its own sub-code
(`AB12-1`, `AB12-2`, …) with its own sticker and barcode, plus a `PORTION 1/3` line on the label.
Scanning a portion sticker in eat-mode marks exactly that portion as eaten (with per-portion undo);
eating or tossing the last open portion completes the whole item — as *tossed* only when every portion
was tossed, otherwise *eaten*. The inspector shows every portion's state (open / eaten by whom, when),
lets you eat, toss or reprint per portion, and resize the batch without disturbing consumed portions.

### Automatic expiry estimation

A seed database of 99 recipes/products with English names (84 ingredients, 15 dishes) maps product names to
shelf-life in days, per location. Typing a name matches conservatively — an exact or near-exact
match is auto-suggested, but a loose one-word overlap is not (so "pizza" won't silently become
"cheese"), and negations like *"macaroni zonder vlees"* ("without meat") correctly exclude templates
that mention the excluded word. Every suggestion can be dismissed in favour of a manual date, a
different template, or an AI estimate.

The full database is editable from the **📚 Templates** manager: built-in templates can be tweaked
(creating a personal override, restorable with one tap) or hidden entirely; you can also add your
own from scratch, with or without AI.

### AI estimates

For anything the database doesn't know, Fridge Assistant can ask an LLM for a conservative,
food-safety-minded shelf-life estimate (days in fridge / freezer / pantry), a category, an emoji, and
a short storage tip — all editable before you save. Two ways to run it:

1. **Your existing Home Assistant conversation agent** (e.g. an OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/Ollama
   integration) — auto-selected, skipping the intent-only default Assist agent.
2. **A direct OpenAI API key** in the integration's options, calling the API directly
   (default model `gpt-4o-mini`).

You can save any AI estimate as a reusable template with one tap.

### Barcode scanning

Tap the 📷 button next to add (➕) to open the scanner. It has two modes:

- **🔎 Search** — scan one of your own printed stickers and its item opens immediately.
- **🍽️ Eat** — scan your own stickers to mark each one *eaten* on the spot, without leaving the
  camera view (handy right after cooking, to clear out what you used).

Scanning a barcode that *isn't* one of your own labels is treated as a **retail barcode** (EAN/UPC):
Fridge Assistant looks it up first against products you've scanned before (works offline, for repeat
purchases), then against [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) (free, no API key) to
pre-fill the name, category, quantity and photo of a new item — you just confirm the location and date.

Three detection tiers keep it working across devices:

1. The native `BarcodeDetector` API (Android / Chromium) for live camera scanning.
2. A bundled [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing-js/library) decoder, lazy-loaded only on devices without
   a native detector (notably iOS) — live camera and photo-capture both work.
3. A photo-capture button and manual code entry as an always-available fallback.

> **Note:** live camera scanning requires a secure context (HTTPS) — it works over Nabu Casa or your
> own TLS, but falls back to photo/manual entry over plain `http://`.

### Multi-user tracking & history

Every item remembers who added it (resolved from the Home Assistant user behind the action) and shows
their avatar — pulled from a linked `person` entity's photo, or coloured initials if there isn't one.

Finishing an item — 🍽️ **Eaten** or 🗑️ **Tossed** — moves it into a **paginated history** log (who,
what, when), reachable via 📜 in the top bar. Every finish action can be **undone**, restoring the item
with its original id and code so a physical sticker still matches. History is capped at the most recent
500 events (a rolling window) so storage stays bounded — but your *active* inventory is never purged
automatically; an item only leaves the fridge when you finish it yourself.

### Notifications

A daily check (time configurable, default 09:00) fires an event and a persistent notification listing
anything expired or expiring within your configured warning window (default 3 days) — split into
"past date" and "expiring soon". You can also trigger the check on demand.

### Mobile-first design

The panel is built to be used one-handed with your phone in hand, standing at the open fridge:

- A native Home Assistant hamburger menu is injected into the panel header (a full-page custom panel
  otherwise has no sidebar access on mobile).
- Safe-area insets (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`) keep controls clear of the notch and home indicator.
- 44px+ tap targets and 16px inputs (avoids iOS auto-zoom on focus).
- A thumb-reachable floating add (➕) and scan (📷) button, bottom-right.

## Language

Fridge Assistant follows a simple rule everywhere — panel, printed labels, AI prompts, and the daily
expiry notification: **Dutch if Home Assistant's language is Dutch, English for anything else.**
There's no third language and no silent fallback to Dutch for an unconfigured or unrecognized
language — only nl/en text ships, and everything else resolves to English.

The panel reads the current user's Home Assistant frontend language (so two people in the same
household can each see their own language); server-rendered text (printed labels, the daily
notification, AI prompts) reads Home Assistant's system-configured language, since those aren't tied
to a specific browser session.

The 99-entry built-in shelf-life catalogue has English names and storage tips. English and
legacy Dutch search aliases are supported. Saved inventory names and customised templates
retain their existing text. On phone screens, expiry badges appear below item names; long
names wrap.

## Installation

### Via HACS (custom repository)

Fridge Assistant isn't in the default HACS store, so add it as a custom repository:

1. HACS → **Integrations** → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/adec/fridge_assistant`, category **Integration**.
3. Install **Fridge Assistant**, then restart Home Assistant.
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Fridge Assistant**.
5. Open **Koelkast** in the sidebar.

### Switching an existing installation to this fork

1. Make a full Home Assistant backup before updating.
2. Keep the existing **Fridge Assistant** entry under **Settings → Devices & Services**.
   Replace only the integration code in `config/custom_components/fridge_assistant`.
3. In HACS, switch the custom repository to `https://github.com/adec/fridge_assistant`
   (category **Integration**) and download this fork. If HACS offers multiple versions,
   select `main` to get these changes. Avoid leaving the upstream repository registered
   for updates to the same integration.
4. Restart Home Assistant, then reload the panel on your phone.

This fork keeps the `fridge_assistant` domain, storage key and storage schema. Inventory,
portions, custom templates, hidden templates and history are loaded from the existing
`config/.storage/fridge_assistant.data` file. Existing integration settings remain in
Home Assistant's configuration entry. Do not delete these storage files or recreate the
integration when switching. Customised templates override their built-in equivalents,
so their saved names and notes are not translated automatically.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/fridge_assistant` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/`
directory, restart Home Assistant, and follow steps 4–5 above.

## Configuration

All options live under **Settings → Devices & Services → Fridge Assistant → Configure**:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Warn this many days before expiry | `3` | How many days ahead "expiring soon" starts. |
| Enable AI estimates | on | Turn AI shelf-life estimation on/off. |
| AI conversation agent | *(auto)* | Which `conversation.*` agent to use. Leave empty to auto-pick an LLM agent. |
| OpenAI API key | *(none)* | If set, estimates call OpenAI directly instead of a conversation agent. |
| OpenAI model | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model used for direct API calls. |
| Item code format | letters-first (`AB12`) | Or digits-first (`12AB`). |
| Enable notifications | on | Toggle the daily expiry notification. |
| Daily check time | `09:00` | When the daily expiry check runs. |
| Enable label printer | off | Turn on once the [add-on](#optional-label-printer-add-on) is installed. |
| Label Printer add-on URL | `http://local-label-printer:8000` | Only change if you renamed/moved the add-on. |
| Copies per print | `1` | How many stickers to print per tap. |

## Services

All services live under the `fridge_assistant` domain and can be called from automations, scripts, or
Developer Tools → Actions.

| Service | Description | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `fridge_assistant.add_item` | Add an item. Expiry is estimated automatically from contents + location if not given. | `name`, `contents`, `location`, `added_date`, `expiry_date`, `quantity`, `portions` |
| `fridge_assistant.update_item` | Update fields on an existing item. | `id`, *(any item field)* |
| `fridge_assistant.remove_item` | Delete an item outright (no history entry). | `id` |
| `fridge_assistant.complete_item` | Finish an item as eaten or tossed — logged to history with who/when. | `id`, `action` (`eaten` / `tossed`) |
| `fridge_assistant.eat_portion` | Mark one portion eaten/tossed; the last portion completes the item. | `id` or `code` (`AB12-2` picks that portion), `portion`, `action` |
| `fridge_assistant.remove_expired` | Clear out everything past its date in one call. | — |
| `fridge_assistant.estimate` | Ask AI to estimate shelf life for a product name. | `name` |
| `fridge_assistant.add_template` | Add or update a template in the shelf-life database. | `name`, *(template fields)* |
| `fridge_assistant.print_sticker` | Render and print a label via the add-on. | `id` |
| `fridge_assistant.run_check` | Run the expiry check immediately (event + notification). | — |

## Sensors

Three sensors are created per config entry:

- **Total items** — count of everything currently in the inventory.
- **Expiring soon** — count of items within the warning window (not yet past date).
- **Expired** — count of items already past their date.

Both expiry sensors expose the matching item list (code, name, days left, ...) as attributes.

## Optional: Label Printer add-on

The integration works completely without a printer — stickers are cosmetic. If you want physical
labels, install the companion **Label Printer** add-on alongside it. It now lives in its own
repository: **[MaxGramser/label-printer-addon](https://github.com/MaxGramser/label-printer-addon)**.
Add that URL under *Settings → Add-ons → Add-on store → ⋮ → Repositories*, install *Label Printer*,
and pick which label roll is loaded (by DYMO part number or Zebra size).

- Generic by design: it accepts any PNG/PDF over HTTP and prints it via CUPS — the integration does
  all the rendering, so the add-on itself has no Fridge Assistant-specific logic.
- Auto-detects **DYMO LabelWriter** and **Zebra** printers over USB, side by side.
- Tested hardware: **DYMO LabelWriter 400/450/550** with **99014** labels (54 × 101 mm) and a
  **Zebra ZD220D** with 104 × 159 mm shipping labels.

After installing, set **Enable label printer** in this integration's options (and adjust the add-on
URL if yours differs — an add-on installed from the repository gets a hostname like
`http://xxxxxxxx-label-printer:8000`, shown on the add-on's page).

## Data & privacy

- All inventory data, templates, and history are stored **locally** in Home Assistant's own storage —
  nothing leaves your network for normal use.
- **AI estimates** send only the product name to your chosen conversation agent or directly to OpenAI
  (if you've configured an API key) — whichever provider you already use for that agent.
- **Retail barcode scanning** sends the scanned barcode number to the free
  [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) API (server-side, from Home Assistant Core, not
  your browser) to resolve a product name/photo. This only happens when you scan a barcode that isn't
  one of your own labels. Nothing else about your inventory is sent.
- The printer add-on communicates only on your local network.

## Known limitations

- Only Dutch and English exist (see [Language](#language)) — the 99-recipe database's product names
  and notes are English regardless of the UI language.
- Live camera barcode scanning requires a secure context (HTTPS); it degrades gracefully to
  photo-capture or manual entry otherwise.
- The label printer add-on has been tested against DYMO LabelWriter 400/450/550 (99014 labels) and a
  Zebra ZD220D (104 × 159 mm); other CUPS-supported label printers may work but are unverified.

The optional, generic CUPS-based print add-on lives in its own repository:
[MaxGramser/label-printer-addon](https://github.com/MaxGramser/label-printer-addon).

Backend changes require a full Home Assistant restart (`ha core restart`) — a config entry reload does
not re-import Python modules. Frontend (`panel.js`) and label design changes only need a browser/app
hard-refresh.
